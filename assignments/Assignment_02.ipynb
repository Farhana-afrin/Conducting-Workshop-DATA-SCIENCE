    "The big battle day is here. There's not been much war in Seven Kingdoms and people's been a bit bored. So, king Bran Stark has organised a dual sword-battle between people by the adivise of Tyrion Lannister, the hand of the king. King invited interested people from all the houses to organize duals. Now, as the dual between two different houses may create anarchy, the wise king decided that the battles will be fought between brothers and one guy will fight once only. That means, a Stark will fight another Stark, a Martell will fight another Martell. People, who will not find a pair, will have to sit and watch the game, and will not get a fight.
