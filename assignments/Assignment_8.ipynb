Although the word \"great\" appeared twice, we count it only once."

WHO notes there are few reports of truly asymptomatic cases. The incubation period, or the time a person takes to show symptoms after getting infected, is the pre-symptomatic phase, the WHO says. Carriers can infect others during this period. Health experts are not yet sure whether asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases are infectious. Some say data so far suggests those cases are probably equally likely to be able to spread infection.\"\n",
